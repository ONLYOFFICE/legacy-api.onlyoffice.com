# Troubleshooting

The most common problems with the editors integration and the ways to solve them.

## Download failed

![e-download.png](/content/img/editor/e-download.png)

The "Download failed" message is displayed at the editors loading process.

The **Document editing service** cannot upload the file for editing.

Check if the link to the file specified in the [document.url](/editors/config/document#url) is correct. The link must be accessible from the **document editing service**.

## No changes

When closing the editor after the editing, the file is unchanged in the **document manager**.

The **document editing service** could not send the data to the **document storage service**.

Check if the [editorConfig.callbackUrl](/editors/config/editor#callbackUrl) link is correct. The saving in the **document manager** must be implemented through the [Callback handler](/editors/callback#implement)

## Could not be saved

The editor is loaded with the "The document could not be saved" message.

The **document editing service** cannot connect to the **document storage service** at the [editorConfig.callbackUrl](/editors/config/editor#callbackUrl) address.

Check if the [Callback handler](/editors/callback#implement) is working correctly. The **document storage service** must return [{"error": 0}](/editors/callback#error-0) in response.

## The file version has been changed

The editor is loaded with the "The file version has been changed. The page will be reloaded" message.

The **document editing service** cannot open the previously edited and saved file for editing.

Do not forget that every time the document is edited and saved, the [document.key](/editors/config/document#key) must be generated anew.

## No collaborative editing

![e-coedit.png](/content/img/editor/e-coedit.png)

No co-editing is available when the document is opened for editing by different users.

The **document editing service** opens **two different** files for editing.

Check if the [document.key](/editors/config/document#key) values coincide to be able to co-edit the same document. The *key* value must change after the save, must differ for different documents and coincide when co-editing one and the same document.

## Invalid token

![e-token.png](/content/img/editor/e-token.png)

The editor is loaded with the "The document security token is not correctly formed. Please contact your Document Server administrator" message.

The **document editing service** requests an encrypted **signature**.

Check if the [token](/editors/config/#token) is correct. The token must be generated in accordance with the [JWT (JSON Web Tokens) standard](/editors/security) and present in **ONLYOFFICE Document Server** config.
