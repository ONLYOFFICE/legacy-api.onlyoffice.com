## Installing ONLYOFFICE Document Server

You will need an instance of ONLYOFFICE Document Server that is resolvable and connectable both from SharePoint and any end clients. ONLYOFFICE Document Server must also be able to POST to SharePoint directly.

You can install free Community version of ONLYOFFICE Document Server or scalable enterprise-level Integration Edition.

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/server/linux/document/linux-installation.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.  

To install Integration Edition, follow instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/server/integration-edition/index.aspx).

Community Edition vs Integration Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-document-server-editions).

## Configuring SharePoint ONLYOFFICE integration solution

```
https://<documentserver>/

Where the documentserver is the name of the server with the ONLYOFFICE Document Server installed. The address must be accessible for the user browser and from the SharePoint server. The SharePoint server address must also be accessible from ONLYOFFICE Document Server for correct work.

## Compiling SharePoint ONLYOFFICE integration solution

If you have SharePoint with version later than 2010, you will not need to change anything, you can compile the project. In case you have SharePoint 2010 and want to build the project for this version, you will need to open the ONLYOFFICE.csproj file and find the lines:

```
<Project ToolsVersion="15.0" DefaultTargets="Build" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworkVersion>v4.5.2</TargetFrameworkVersion>
    <TargetOfficeVersion>15.0</TargetOfficeVersion>
```

Replace these lines with the following ones:

```
<Project ToolsVersion="14.0" DefaultTargets="Build" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworkVersion>v3.5</TargetFrameworkVersion>
    <TargetOfficeVersion>14.0</TargetOfficeVersion>
```

And go to the steps below after that.

There are two ways to compile ONLYOFFICE SharePoint integration solution:

a. Using MS Visual Studio:
1. Enter the SharePoint server and open this project in Visual Studio.
2. In Solution Explorer, open the shortcut menu for the project and then choose Publish.
3. In the Publish dialog box, choose the Publish to File System option button.
4. Click the Publish button. When the publishing process is finished, the solution .wsp file will be created.
5. Copy the resulting file to the folder with the Install.ps1 file (BuildAndInstall folder by default).

b. With the help of the build.bat file provided:
1. Go to the BuildAndInstall folder.
2. Run the build.bat file.
3. The resulting solution .wsp file will be created and placed to the BuildAndInstall folder.

## How it works

* User navigates to a document within SharePoint and selects the Edit in ONLYOFFICE action on context menu or ribbon.
* SharePoint ONLYOFFICE solution makes a request to the editor page (URL of the form: `/_layouts/15/Onlyoffice/editorPage.aspx?SPListItemId={SelectedItemId}&SPListId={SelectedListId}&SPSource={Source}&SPListURLDir={ListUrlDir}`).
* SharePoint ONLYOFFICE solution prepares a JSON object with the following properties:
  * **url** - the URL that ONLYOFFICE Document Server uses to download the document;
  * **callback** - the URL that ONLYOFFICE Document Server informs about status of the document editing;
  * **documentServerUrl** - the URL that the client needs to reply to ONLYOFFICE Document Server (can be set at the settings page);
  * **key** - the file identificator from SharePoint;
  * **fileName** - the document Title (name);
  * **userId** - the identification of the user;
  * **userName** - the name of the user.

* SharePoint ONLYOFFICE solution constructs a page, filling in all of those values so that the client browser can load up the editor.
* The client browser makes a request for the javascript library from ONLYOFFICE Document Server and sends ONLYOFFICE Document Server the DocEditor configuration with the above properties.
* Then ONLYOFFICE Document Server downloads the document from SharePoint and the user begins editing.
* When all users and client browsers are done with editing, they close the editing window.
* After 10 seconds of inactivity, ONLYOFFICE Document Server sends a POST to the callback URL letting SharePoint ONLYOFFICE solution know that the clients have finished editing the document and closed it.
* SharePoint ONLYOFFICE solution downloads the new version of the document, replacing the old one.
