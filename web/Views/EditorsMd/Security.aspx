    <p class="dscr">To prevent the substitution of important parameters in ONLYOFFICE Document Server requests an encrypted signature is added to it in the form of <b>token</b>.</p>
    <p>The <b>token</b> is added in the configuration when initializing <b>Document Editor</b> and during the exchange of commands between <b>document storage service</b> and <b>document editing service</b>, <b>document command service</b>, <b>document conversion service</b> and <b>document builder service</b>.</p>

    <p>
        The <b>token</b> is generated using the <em>JWT</em> (<a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">JSON Web Tokens</a>) standard.
        The tokens are signed by the server's key, so the client is able to verify that the token is legitimate.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>JSON Web Tokens</em> consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are: <em>header</em>, <em>payload</em>, <em>signature</em>.
        The <em>header</em> consists of two parts: the type of the token (<em>JWT</em>), and the hashing algorithm (<em>HMAC SHA256</em>).
        The second part of the token is the <em>payload</em>, which contains the claims in JSON format.
        To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>ONLYOFFICE Document Server</b> validates the <b>token</b>.
        The data from the <em>payload</em> is considered valid and is used instead of the corresponding data from the main parameters.
        If the <b>token</b> is invalid, the command is not executed.<p>
